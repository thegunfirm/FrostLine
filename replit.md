# Rest Express - Firearms E-commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack e-commerce platform specifically designed for firearms and related accessories. The application features a React frontend with a Node.js Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and a comprehensive tier-based membership system. The platform handles FFL (Federal Firearms License) requirements, specialized shipping policies, and offers tiered pricing benefits.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Tier-based Membership System**: Bronze, Gold, and Platinum tiers with different pricing and benefits
2. **FFL Integration**: Built-in handling for firearms that require Federal Firearms License transfers  
3. **Specialized Commerce Features**: Gun-specific categories, manufacturer filtering, and compliance features
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with custom breakpoints
5. **Brand-focused UI**: Custom color scheme and typography reflecting firearms industry aesthetics
6. **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Multi-layer search system combining RSR API, Algolia indexing, and internal AI learning

- Real-time savings calculations and tier upgrade recommendations
- Personalized pricing display based on current membership
- Upgrade path visualization and benefit comparison

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Login/register → Session creation → User context update → Protected route access
2. **Product Discovery**: Search/browse → Filter application → Tier-based pricing calculation → Display results
3. **Order Processing**: Cart management → FFL verification → Compliance checking → Order creation → Fulfillment routing
