# Rest Express - Firearms E-commerce Platform

## Overview
This is a full-stack e-commerce platform for firearms and accessories, featuring a React frontend, Node.js Express backend, and PostgreSQL database. It includes a comprehensive tier-based membership system, handles FFL (Federal Firearms License) requirements, specialized shipping policies, and offers tiered pricing benefits. The platform aims to provide a robust, compliance-aware online marketplace for the firearms industry, integrating real-time inventory and advanced search capabilities.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Image policy: NEVER use Unsplash or any placeholder images. Only use authentic distributor images (RSR, etc.) even if they show "Image Coming Soon" placeholders.
Code preservation: Always maintain working solutions - never overwrite functioning code without explicit user request.
Email verification: Users must verify their email address before being able to sign in (implemented 2025-08-05).
Testing policy: No assumptions - use test or dummy data ONLY FOR FAKE USERS. Inventory must always remain intact with authentic RSR data. No test data should ever be added to real product inventory. FFL directory must use only authentic FFL data - no fake dealers should be added to the system.
**CRITICAL IMAGE HANDLING RULE (2025-08-06)**: For product images in cart/order displays, NEVER use containers with gray backgrounds or fixed heights. Use direct image elements with `w-[size] h-auto object-contain` classes only. This prevents background showing through and maintains natural image proportions. This has been an issue multiple times - always use this simple approach.

**CART CORRUPTION SOLUTION (2025-08-06)**: Cart items persistently reappearing due to localStorage persistence issues. Fixed with comprehensive clearing mechanism including both localStorage removal and server-side force-clear endpoint. Script provided for manual clearing when corruption occurs.

**FFL SELECTOR IMPROVEMENTS (2025-08-06)**: Fixed indefinite loading issues in FFL selector component by adding proper error handling, loading states, and retry logic. Component now gracefully handles network timeouts and provides clear user feedback.

**GLOBAL SCROLL-TO-TOP (2025-08-07)**: Implemented site-wide scroll-to-top functionality using wouter's useLocation hook - all page navigation now automatically scrolls to top for improved UX.

**DATABASE SCHEMA FIXES (2025-08-07)**: Resolved missing columns error in orders table by adding fulfillment_groups, authorize_net_transaction_id, and payment_method columns to support complete order tracking.
