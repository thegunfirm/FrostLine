# Rest Express - Firearms E-commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack e-commerce platform specifically designed for firearms and related accessories. The application features a React frontend with a Node.js Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and a comprehensive tier-based membership system. The platform handles FFL (Federal Firearms License) requirements, specialized shipping policies, and offers tiered pricing benefits.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Tier-based Membership System**: Bronze, Gold, and Platinum tiers with different pricing and benefits
2. **FFL Integration**: Built-in handling for firearms that require Federal Firearms License transfers  
3. **Specialized Commerce Features**: Gun-specific categories, manufacturer filtering, and compliance features
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with custom breakpoints
5. **Brand-focused UI**: Custom color scheme and typography reflecting firearms industry aesthetics
6. **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Multi-layer search system combining RSR API, Algolia indexing, and internal AI learning

- Real-time savings calculations and tier upgrade recommendations
- Personalized pricing display based on current membership
- Upgrade path visualization and benefit comparison

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Login/register → Session creation → User context update → Protected route access
2. **Product Discovery**: Search/browse → Filter application → Tier-based pricing calculation → Display results
3. **Order Processing**: Cart management → FFL verification → Compliance checking → Order creation → Fulfillment routing

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Image policy: NEVER use Unsplash or any placeholder images. Only use authentic distributor images (RSR, etc.) even if they show "Image Coming Soon" placeholders.
Code preservation: Always maintain working solutions - never overwrite functioning code without explicit user request.
```

## CRITICAL WORKING SOLUTIONS - DO NOT OVERWRITE

**⚠️ CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL**: If user instructions conflict with any "DO NOT MODIFY" section below, STOP immediately and ask the user to resolve the conflict before proceeding.

### Cart Pricing System (WORKING - DO NOT MODIFY)
**Location**: `client/src/pages/cart.tsx` lines 85-104
**Function**: Three-tier pricing display for non-authenticated users in cart page
**Key Features**: 
- Bronze: Uses `item.priceBronze || item.price`
- Gold: Uses `item.priceGold || item.price`
- Platinum: Uses `item.pricePlatinum || item.price` (CRITICAL - was previously showing `item.price` only)
**Status**: WORKING - displays authentic RSR pricing tiers with proper membership incentives
**User Note**: "Do not touch the pricing in the UI or UX" - pricing display logic is finalized and operational

### RSR Image System (WORKING - DO NOT MODIFY)
**Location**: `server/routes.ts` lines 1489-1558
**Function**: `/api/rsr-image/:imageName` endpoint
**Key Feature**: Handles both `angle` and `view` parameters for multi-angle RSR images
**Frontend Integration**: `client/src/pages/product-detail.tsx` uses `angle` parameter
**Status**: WORKING - handles multiple image angles when available from RSR

### Rifle/Shotgun Categorization (WORKING - DO NOT MODIFY)
**Location**: `server/routes.ts` lines 2167-2178  
**Function**: Category-based filtering for rifles vs shotguns
**Key Feature**: Uses `categoryName:"Rifles"` and `categoryName:"Shotguns"` instead of department-only filtering
**Results**: 3,710 rifles, 452 shotguns, 4,162 total long guns
**Status**: WORKING - maintains proper subcategorization

### Algolia Search Integration (WORKING - DO NOT MODIFY)
**Location**: `server/routes.ts` lines 2111-2300+
**Function**: Complete search system with department and category filtering
**Key Feature**: Handles all categories with proper RSR department mapping
**Status**: WORKING - 29,836 products indexed and searchable

### Category-Specific Caliber Filtering (WORKING - DO NOT MODIFY)
**Location**: `server/routes.ts` lines 2514-2523
**Function**: `/api/search/filter-options` endpoint with category-specific filtering
**Key Feature**: Distinguishes between rifles and shotguns using both departmentNumber and categoryName filters
**Filter Logic**: 
- Rifles: `departmentNumber:"05"` AND `categoryName:"Rifles"`
- Shotguns: `departmentNumber:"05"` AND `categoryName:"Shotguns"`
**Result**: Rifles show rifle calibers (.308, .223, etc.), Shotguns show gauge calibers (12 Gauge, 20 Gauge, etc.)
**Frontend Integration**: `client/src/components/search/algolia-search.tsx` lines 130-138 passes filters to backend
**Status**: WORKING - Category-specific caliber filtering operational with zero cross-contamination

### Filter Options API Architecture (WORKING - DO NOT MODIFY)
**Location**: `server/routes.ts` lines 2500-2600+
**Function**: Dynamic filter options endpoint that returns category-specific filter values
**Key Components**:
- Base filter building with category-specific logic (lines 2511-2534)
- RSR department-based filtering for all categories:
  - Handguns: departmentNumber:"01"
  - Rifles: departmentNumber:"05" AND categoryName:"Rifles"
  - Shotguns: departmentNumber:"05" AND categoryName:"Shotguns"
  - Ammunition: departmentNumber:"18"
  - Optics: departmentNumber:"08"
  - NFA: departmentNumber:"06"
  - Parts: departmentNumber:"34"
  - Accessories: Multiple departments (09,11,12,13,14,17,20,21,25,26,27,30,31,35)
- Algolia facet search for each filter type (manufacturerName, caliber, tierPricing.platinum, etc.)
- Returns only available options with counts for current category/filters
**Frontend Integration**: `client/src/components/search/algolia-search.tsx` passes current filters to get relevant options
**Status**: WORKING - All categories operational with full manufacturer and filter options
