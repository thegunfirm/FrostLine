# Rest Express - Firearms E-commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack e-commerce platform specifically designed for firearms and related accessories. The application features a React frontend with a Node.js Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and a comprehensive tier-based membership system. The platform handles FFL (Federal Firearms License) requirements, specialized shipping policies, and offers tiered pricing benefits.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for authentication
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom brand colors and design system
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Session-based with bcrypt password hashing
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Tier-based Membership System**: Bronze, Gold, and Platinum tiers with different pricing and benefits
2. **FFL Integration**: Built-in handling for firearms that require Federal Firearms License transfers  
3. **Specialized Commerce Features**: Gun-specific categories, manufacturer filtering, and compliance features
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with custom breakpoints
5. **Brand-focused UI**: Custom color scheme and typography reflecting firearms industry aesthetics
6. **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Multi-layer search system combining RSR API, Algolia indexing, and internal AI learning
7. **Real-time Inventory**: Live inventory sync with RSR distributor data for accurate stock levels
8. **Payment Dual System**: Separate Authorize.Net credentials for product vs membership payments

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Customer accounts with tier-based membership, shipping preferences, and FFL associations
- **Products**: Firearms and accessories with tier-specific pricing, FFL requirements, and inventory management
- **Orders**: Purchase history with FFL routing and compliance tracking
- **FFLs**: Federal Firearms License dealer directory
- **State Shipping Policies**: Compliance rules for different states
- **Tier Pricing Rules**: Dynamic pricing based on membership levels

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication with secure password hashing
- Role-based access control (user, admin, support, dealer)
- Persistent login state with localStorage backup
- Protected routes and API endpoints

### Product Management
- Multi-tier pricing structure (Bronze, Gold, Platinum)
- FFL requirement tracking and routing
- Inventory management with stock tracking
- Category-based organization with manufacturer filtering
- Advanced search functionality with multiple filters

### Membership System
- Three-tier structure with progressive benefits
- Real-time savings calculations and tier upgrade recommendations
- Personalized pricing display based on current membership
- Upgrade path visualization and benefit comparison

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Login/register → Session creation → User context update → Protected route access
2. **Product Discovery**: Search/browse → Filter application → Tier-based pricing calculation → Display results
3. **Order Processing**: Cart management → FFL verification → Compliance checking → Order creation → Fulfillment routing
4. **Membership Management**: Tier evaluation → Savings calculation → Upgrade recommendations → Benefit application
