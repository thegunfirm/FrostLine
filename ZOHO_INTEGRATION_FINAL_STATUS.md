## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Products Module Issue
The Zoho CRM setup doesn't support the Products module API, returning:
```
{
  "code": "API_NOT_SUPPORTED",
  "message": "api not supported in this version",
  "status": "error"
}
```

**Status: REQUIRES PROPER RESOLUTION**
- No workarounds implemented per user requirements
- Product creation currently disabled
- Needs proper Zoho CRM Products module configuration
- May require Zoho admin to enable Products module or provide correct API endpoint
